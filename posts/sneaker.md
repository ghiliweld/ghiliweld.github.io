# Fair Sneaker Drops

> This is a working draft

- sneaker drops get botted because there is a gap between what fans will pay for these shoes and the MSRP.
- a dutch auction is an obvious mechanism for disuading bots since a fan who wants the shoes at high prices can simply buy them during the auction. there is no room for resellers to turn a profit.
- sneaker companies won't use dutch auctions since only fans with more money will be able to afford sneakers. they want sneaker drops to at least seem fair.
- not to mention the fact that capturing the difference between the auction sale price and the MSRP would be really bad PR for those companies lol.
- this motivated the use of raffles to level the playing field.
- i don't think all is lost with dutch auctions tho. i think redistributing the proceeds from earlier sales in a dutch auction could allow other fans to purchase shoes without breaking the bank.
- it's just a question on how to do redistribute those proceeds in a way that can't be gamed.
- [sybil-proof cake cutting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12813.pdf) could solve this.
