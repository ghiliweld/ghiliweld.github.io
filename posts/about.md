Hi I'm Ghilia! I'm a researcher and engineer, working on interesting problems in DeFi and the blockchain space.

I previously studied Mathematics and Computer Science at McGill University.

*I believe onchain [mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design) will be the institutions of the future.*
