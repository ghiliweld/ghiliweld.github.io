## Work Experience
- **Community Management @ AirSwap** (2017)

## Projects and Accomplishments
- **r/tokentrade**
Tokentrade is a subreddit that operates as a makeshift decentralized ERC20 token exchange. What that means is that you can post orders via the 0x OTC Dapp on the subreddit and if someone likes your offer they can chose to fill your order. It’s an easy, safe and decentralized way to trade tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Our subreddit even got featured in an article on [ETHNews](https://www.ethnews.com/bootstrapping-an-over-the-counter-cryptocurrency-exchange). What I love the most about this project was the fact that it took just a few minutes to get up and running and it’s widespread use was almost immediate. We really hit the nail on this one, product-market fit wise.
