                    sneaker drops get botted because there is a gap between what
                    fans will pay for these shoes and the MSRP.
                </li>
                <li>
                    a dutch auction is an obvious mechanism for disuading bots
                    since a fan who wants the shoes at high prices can simply
                    buy them during the auction. there is no room for resellers
                    to turn a profit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    sneaker companies won&#39;t use dutch auctions since only
                    fans with more money will be able to afford sneakers. they
                    want sneaker drops to at least seem fair.
                </li>
                <li>
                    not to mention the fact that capturing the difference
                    between the auction sale price and the MSRP would be really
                    bad PR for those companies lol.
                </li>
                <li>
                    this motivated the use of raffles to level the playing
                    field.

                <li>
                    i don&#39;t think all is lost with dutch auctions tho. i
                    think redistributing the proceeds from earlier sales in a
                    dutch auction could allow other fans to purchase shoes
                    without breaking the bank.
                </li>
                <li>
                    it&#39;s just a question on how to do redistribute those
                    proceeds in a way that can&#39;t be gamed.

                    could solve this.
