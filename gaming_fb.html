                    Lessons Learned from Trying to Game the Flashbots Auction
                </h1>
                <p>
                    After following the MEV space for a while, I wanted to try
                    my hand at building a searcher bot during my winter break
                    from school. I had an idea for an interesting sandwiching
                    strategy (might write about it later), but since my bot
                    would be using flashbots I&#39;d have to find a way to win
                    the flashbots auction while still maximizing profits.
                    Sandwiching is a competitive field and so vying for the same
                    sandwiching opportunity as countless other searchers would
                    force me to give away profits to guarantee winning the
                    auction. You walk away with less, but at least it&#39;s
                    something.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what if there was a way to game the auctions so that you
                    can secure a spot at the top of a block
                    <em>without</em> giving away most of your profit? It&#39;s
                    like having your cake and eating it too, but the cake is
                    money (loads of it). My attempt at doing so is what this
                    post is about. Althought it didn&#39;t work, I still think
                    it wasn&#39;t a terrible idea and I learned something new
                    about geth in the end.
                </p>
                <h2 id="some-background">Some Background</h2>
                <p>
                    For my searchers already familiar with flashbots, recall
                    that bundles are sorted by effective gas price (<code
                        >mevGasPrice</code
                    >
                    in mev-geth, i may also refer to it as &quot;score&quot;).
                    Searchers aiming for the same opportunity in a block have to
                    outbid other searchers for it, leaving barely any profit for
                    themselves, since only one searcher can profit from the
                    opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recall some properties about flashbots bundles and the
                    auction:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code
                            >mevGasPrice := [delta_coinbase + (gasUsed *
                            gasPrice)] / gasUsed</code
                        >
                        where <code>delta_coinbase</code> is the amount directly
                        sent to the miner&#39;s coinbase address. (note:
                        it&#39;s a really a sum of
                        <code>gasUsed * gasPrice</code> across all txs in a
                        bundle, but this definition is simpler for what I want
                        to show)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        if we don&#39;t make any direct payments to the miner
                        (i.e. <code>delta_coinbase = 0</code>) then
                        <code>mevGasPrice = gasPrice</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        if any tx in a bundle reverts then the bundle won&#39;t
                        land onchain <em>unless</em> the hash of the tx in
                        question is included in the
                        <code>revertingTxHashes</code> field of our bundle
                        request.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We can look at the effectice gas price as a measure of
                    &quot;profit per compute&quot; for the miner, and so to
                    maximize revenue for the miner flashbots prioritizes bundles
                    that pay more per gas used. Making a direct payment to the
                    miner requires additional gas and so it&#39;s more
                    economical to omit the direct payment and pay by upping the
                    gas price on your swaps (or wtv txs your strat entails).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we have to up the gas price on our txs to ensure we win
                    the opportunity, then we need to lower our gas used in order
                    to bank more profit. Hence why you&#39;ve probably noticed
                    your favourite 0xAnimeFemboy mev account on the tl shilling
                    yul+. Writing the most gas efficient contract means you can
                    safely up your gas price which means easy $$$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&#39;m lazy and I only had about 2 weeks until I started
                    school again, so I wasn&#39;t about to become an
                    optimizoooor. Instead, I was gonna try gaming the auction.
                    Someone already gamed the auction before, where they
                    <a
                        href="https://twitter.com/bertcmiller/status/1407305924600029189"
                        >reduced their gas price after their bundle got
                        merged</a
                    >. I was gonna try using way less gas than flashbots would
                    expect.
                </p>
                <h2 id="the-strategy">The Strategy</h2>
                <p>
                    The strat entailed making use of this fun little fact about
                    gas limits:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        [I]f you put a gas limit of 50,000 for a simple ETH
                        transfer, the EVM would consume 21,000, and you would
                        get back the remaining 29,000. However, if you specify
                        too little gas, for example, a gas limit of 20,000 for a
                        simple ETH transfer, the EVM will consume your 20,000
                        gas units attempting to fulfill the transaction, but it
                        will not complete. The EVM then reverts any changes, but
                        since the miner has already done 20k gas units worth of
                        work, that gas is consumed.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    from
                    <a
                        href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/#what-is-gas-limit"
                        >ethereum.org</a
                    >
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that the definition of the effective gas price
                    didn&#39;t require that any of our smart contract txs pay
                    the bribe to the miner. Say we included an eth transfer in
                    our bundle that handled our bribe, and that we set the gas
                    limit to <code>1 gas</code> and the gas price to
                    <code>100k gwei/gas</code>. We&#39;d need to allow this tx
                    to revert in our bundle (via <code>revertingTxHashes</code>)
                    since any tx with a gas limit lower than 21k gas would
                    revert. Our bundle could then land onchain, revert, and only
                    consume 1 gas in doing so. This will only cost us
                    <code>1 gas * 100k gwei/gas = 100k gwei</code> and our
                    bundle&#39;s score would be boosted by
                    <code>100k</code> which guarantees us first priority in the
                    auction by a large margin. We can then safely set the gas
                    price on our swaps to whatever the <code>base_fee</code> was
                    that block since we don&#39;t wanna compete on gas price
                    with high gas txs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those familiar with geth have probably noticed the flaw in
                    this strategy by now and already know where this is going,
                    but I won&#39;t spoil the (unfortunate) surprise just yet.
                </p>
                <h2 id="the-attempt">The Attempt</h2>
                <p>
                    Before my attempt, I needed to check if this would be
                    possible in mev-geth. So I took a look at the
                    <a
                        href="https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth/blob/master/miner/worker.go#L1414"
                        ><code>computeBundleGas</code></a
                    >
                    method, which is what returns our bundle&#39;s score
                    (<code>mevGasPrice</code>). These lines in particular were
                    of interest.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="lang-go">receipt, err := core.ApplyTransaction(w<span class="hljs-selector-class">.chainConfig</span>, w<span class="hljs-selector-class">.chain</span>, &amp;w<span class="hljs-selector-class">.coinbase</span>, gasPool, state, <span class="hljs-selector-tag">header</span>, tx, &amp;tempGasUsed, *w<span class="hljs-selector-class">.chain</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.GetVMConfig</span>())
                <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> err != nil {
                    return simulatedBundle{}, err
                }
                <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> receipt<span class="hljs-selector-class">.Status</span> == types<span class="hljs-selector-class">.ReceiptStatusFailed</span> &amp;&amp; !containsHash(bundle<span class="hljs-selector-class">.RevertingTxHashes</span>, receipt.TxHash) {
                    return simulatedBundle{}, errors.New(<span class="hljs-string">"failed tx"</span>)
                }
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    The first line applies the tx and returns a receipt and any
                    errors encoutered. If the receipt showed the tx failed and
                    reverted and wasn&#39;t included in our bundle&#39;s
                    <code>revertingTxHashes</code> then we would throw an error
                    and reject the bundle. But if we did include our tx in the
                    <code>revertingTxHashes</code> then our method would proceed
                    as normal and add our <code>gasUsed</code> and
                    <code>gasPrice</code> to the tally, gaming the flashbots
                    auction for the low. I thought the <code>err</code> variable
                    was interesting but didn&#39;t give it much thought at
                    first. That proved to be a fatal mistake later on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I get to testing, submiting my bundles with this lil hack
                    thinking it&#39;s gonna go through. That&#39;s when I get
                    hit with an <code>intrinsic gas too low</code> error saying
                    I need to supply 21k gas instead of just 1 gas. After some
                    digging I found out this wasn&#39;t a flashbots error but
                    rather an
                    <a
                        href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/state_transition.go#L298"
                        >error that geth itself was throwing</a
                    >
                    (coming from <code>core.ApplyTransaction</code>). Turns out
                    geth <em>won&#39;t even broadcast</em> a tx destined to fail
                    at all, which makes sense since that&#39;s pointless compute
                    being spent by the miner for no real reason. Unfortunately,
                    my strategy depended on the fact that we were intentionally
                    letting a tx land onchain so it would fail, and geth
                    completely foiled those plans.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    Like I said in the beginning, this wasn&#39;t my worst idea
                    ever. I just wasn&#39;t expecting geth to intervene like
                    that when I saw on ethereum&#39;s website that any gas under
                    21k is consumed whether the tx reverts or not. I later
                    realized that that was describing the EVM&#39;s behaviour,
                    not the client&#39;s (geth) which was free to implement any
                    checks beforehand. Unfortunate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Edit: Apparently this is standard client behaviour as
                    described in section 6 of the
                    <a href="https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf"
                        >yellowpaper</a
                    >
                    and not unique to geth (s/o to the homie
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/0xalpharush">@0xalpharush</a>
                    for pointing this out). But that was in the Berlin version
                    of the yellowpaper, so now I&#39;m still not sure if the
                    official site was completely wrong or just outdated.
                    That&#39;s on me though, I should&#39;ve just read the code
                    for myself first instead of going off the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&#39;m still not interested in being an optimizooor despite
                    not being able to game the auction, and I learned just how
                    involved building a competitive searcher bot is over my
                    winter break. It&#39;s definitely not something I can slap
                    together in 2 weeks like I originally planned. I&#39;ll see
                    how I end up going about this mev shit but I&#39;ll have to
                    take my time with it if I wanna be competitive.
