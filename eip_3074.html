                    Are you reading up on new

                    anon? One of my favourite pastimes is trying to predict the
                    landscape of MEV in the near future. I sometimes find myself
                    getting ideas for strategies that might be profitable later
                    on, just not now.

                    was one of those moments. I&#39;ll be sharing an interesting
                    frontrunning strategy I came up with that could work post
                    3074.

                    I&#39;m not usually one for posting predictions, but some
                    interesting ideas came up from this that I felt should be
                    published.

                <h2 id="a-primer-on-eip-3074">A Primer on EIP-3074</h2>
                <p>
                    One glaring UX problem on Ethereum is the fact that
                    Externally Owned Accounts (basically your wallet) can&#39;t
                    make multiple calls to different smart contracts in one tx
                    (multicalls). That&#39;s why we have the approve tx -&gt;
                    swap tx flow for ERC20 swaps on DEXs today. EIP-3074 solves
                    this, among other things. It doesn&#39;t let you make
                    multicalls from your EOA directly, but it does allow a
                    contract to make calls to other contracts <em>as if</em> it
                    was coming from your EOA (i.e.
                    <code>msg.sender = EOA</code>) which achieves the same
                    thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The EIP introduces two new opcodes, <code>AUTH</code> and
                    <code>AUTHCALL</code>, and a new solidity built-in function
                    <code>authorize</code>. The contract we make the 3074-tx
                    through is called an <strong>invoker</strong>. The flow is
                    simple:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        a user signs a <code>commitment</code> (hash) of what
                        they want their tx to do, and signs it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the user calls the invoker and passes in what contract
                        they want to call, along with the calldata, and the
                        signature of the commitment
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the invoker hashes the args to reconstruct the
                        commitment
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>authorize(commitment, signature)</code> returns
                        the user&#39;s EOA address and also loads it in
                        temporary storage by the <code>AUTH</code> opcode
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the invoker makes an <code>AUTHCALL</code> with the
                        contract and calldata (like
                        <code>contract.authcall(calldata);</code>)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the <code>msg.sender</code> in that authcall will be our
                        user&#39;s address even thought the invoker (a contract)
                        is making the call
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Note that since a signature and commitment is all that&#39;s
                    needed to get the EOA address, the user doesn&#39;t have to
                    submit this themselves. In fact, someone could pay the gas
                    fees for them and submit it on their behalf. Sponsoring gas
                    fees was also a motivation for the EIP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An invoker contract will look something like

                <p>
                    One way of thinking about 3074 txs is like multicalls that
                    <em>anyone</em> can do on your behalf provided they have the
                    commitment and your signature. The individuals calls to
                    other contracts will look like regular internal contract
                    calls to anyone viewing your transaction. This is where the
                    fun part starts. If you&#39;ve read
                    <a
                        href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest/"
                        >Ethereum is a Dark Forest</a
                    >
                    then you&#39;ll know that advanced searchers are lurking in
                    the mempool for any profitable transactions, even going so
                    far as to look over <em>internal calls</em> that they can
                    frontrun. What happens when a 3074 tx is making internal
                    calls that we can not only frontrun, but extract and include
                    in our tx instead? A quick example can demonstrate why a
                    searcher would do that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We were able to sandwich an incoming 3074 tx the traditional
                    way (over 3 txs) or we could extract the commitment and
                    signature details from the pending DEX swap and place it in
                    our own tx, that way we could execute a sandwich in only one
                    tx! We get some interesting results from this:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        we are paying a victim&#39;s gas fees in exchange for
                        screwing them over by sandwiching them (chaotic
                        neutral?)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        we save on gas since we&#39;re executing a sandwich in 1
                        tx
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        we can take out a flashloan to sandwich a trade instead
                        of putting up our own capital
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    What actually got me looking at EIP-3074 in the first place
                    was because I wanted to take out a flashloan to execute a
                    sandwich, which isn&#39;t possible over 3 txs since I&#39;d
                    need to return what I borrowed in the same tx. Where
                    arbitrage was the only strategy that could use flashloans,
                    3074 now opens up flashloans for use in many more MEV
                    strategies.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    I don&#39;t think this sandwich scenario is any cause for
                    concern, the existence of EIP-3074 didn&#39;t create new a
                    MEV opportunity it just changed how we could profit from it.
                    Notice how even if we didn&#39;t extract the internal call,
                    the swap was still very much sandwichable. The only
                    difference is someone with enough capital could have taken
                    full advantage of the sandwich in the first scenario,
                    whereas the second one doesn&#39;t have any capital
                    requirements (besides gas fees ofc). I think that&#39;s
                    pretty cool, it levels the playing field even more in my
                    opinion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That being said, that only applies with current MEV
                    strategies. There&#39;s no telling what 3074 opens up for
                    searchers. Remember, unless implemented properly, a call to
                    an invoker can be frontrun and a tx coming from your EOA can
                    be included as an internal call in anyone&#39;s tx. If
                    developers want to mitigate against any unpredictable
                    attacks they may want to add a
                    <code>address relayer</code> parameter to the
                    <code>sponsor</code> function above so the invoker can
                    assert the sponsor is who we expect it to be (<code
                        >require(msg.sender == relayer);</code
                    >). This at least preserves the current MEV status quo, and
                    won&#39;t add on to it.
                </p>
                <p>But otherwise, gud eip honestly.</p>
