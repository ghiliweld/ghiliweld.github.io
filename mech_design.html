                I struggle a lot with explaining what it is I do exactly. I can
                talk about my job or certain projects I&#39;m working on, but
                it&#39;s difficult to put it in the context of the industry I
                work in.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>I do mechanism design research.</strong> I&#39;ve gotten
                better at explaining what that can look like, giving examples of
                auction design or work that I&#39;ve done with clients. However,
                I still can&#39;t get to what it is at its core, and why this is
                what I chose to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I would start going into what a mechanism is, I usually
                started waffling on about how a mechanism is a &quot;sort of
                system&quot; between many &quot;players&quot; designed to
                benefit all these players in some way and that (hopefully)
                can&#39;t be gamed. I would quickly move on to examples before I
                lost whoever I was speaking to for good.
            </p>
            <p>
                Proper mechanism design is critical in marketplaces. Taylor
                Swift fans and sneakerheads might not be familiar with mechanism
                design but if you talk to them about it they understand
                immediately why mechanism design is crucial.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like
                <a href="https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/"
                    >Vitalik&#39;s definition</a
                >
                that mechanisms are algorithms plus incentives. It gives an idea
                of what a mechanism looks like in its most distilled form:
                it&#39;s an algorithm, a procedure of sorts. Most people are
                familiar with the word &quot;algorithm&quot; by now, and to the
                initiated, it provides a hint of the level of rigour that
                mechanisms are analyzed with. Adding incentives on top gives us
                a glimpse into what&#39;s at stake in these systems and the
                motivations of their participants. I want to hone in on this
                definition because Vitalik gives some good examples of
                mechanisms so you get the general idea and potential scale that
                mechanism designers work with, but he doesn&#39;t explain how
                mechanism design is done.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why would a mechanism be an algorithm, and what kind of
                algorithm is it? What kind of inputs do these algorithms take?
                What does &quot;plus incentives&quot; entail and how can we
                design for that?
            </p>
            <p>
                Let&#39;s start by going over the different players (also called
                agents).
            </p>
            <p>
                There&#39;s the <em>Mechanism Designer</em> (MD for short), this
                is who designs the mechanism and wants other players to use
                their mechanism (imagine we&#39;re talking about a marketplace
                here) for some reason. They&#39;re not normally modelled as an
                agent, but it would be a mistake to not account for them as they
                may be able to participate in their mechanism for their gain and
                the detriment of others. Let&#39;s say we&#39;re the MD for the
                rest of this post.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are honest agents, who participate as the MD intends
                players to. They are the ideal participants for a mechanism
                designer. If every agent was honest, mechanism design probably
                wouldn&#39;t be a field of study in the first place. However,
                they&#39;re worth including in our model as they are our most
                desirable participants and we want to protect their interests as
                the MD.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, we have rational agents, these aren&#39;t necessarily bad
                players but they are expected to do anything to advance their
                interests. In the case of marketplaces, this can mean making
                more money by using bots to quickly buy up the supply of some
                items (tickets, sneakers, etc...). For rational agents, other
                playersâ€™ needs aren&#39;t a concern as long as they fulfill
                theirs. This is what motivates the study of mechanism design. A
                mechanism designer wants to either restrict or properly
                incentivize rational agents into acting honestly so as not to
                ruin the fun for everyone else. When done right, rational agents
                have no better alternative than playing by the rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, we have adversarial agents. These are the bad guys who
                want to ruin the party by any means necessary, for no real
                material gain. While not every mechanism will have to deal with
                this type of player, as someone would need the motivation to do
                so without some sort of profit, it&#39;s important to know this
                type of agent exists and may try to throw a wrench in your
                mechanism. DoS attacks are an example of what adversaries might
                try, which is why
                <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/">gas</a>
                is a thing on Ethereum.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Mechanism Designer wants to host/offer some sort of
                marketplace or service. As a player themselves, they of course
                have their own <em>objective</em> like making a profit, but they
                usually do care about the best interests of the players who use
                their mechanism. We call this social welfare and it is something
                we aim to maximize as mechanism designers since we also want
                people to use our mechanism. No one will use our marketplace if
                they don&#39;t get anything good out of it too, and we won&#39;t
                make any revenue as a consequence.
            </p>
            <p>Examples of objectives a MD could have are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    maximizing revenue from the sale of an item and ensuring the
                    items sold go to honest agents (<a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction_theory"
                        >auction theory</a
                    >)
                </li>
                <li>
                    decreasing congestion on roads and networks (<a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_game"
                        >congestion games</a
                    >) they want people to use
                </li>
                <li>
                    ensure fairness and incentivize agents to behave honestly
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Honest and rational agents want to use our marketplace with
                their objectives in mind. Recall that the MD can be one of the
                honest or rational agents. Adversaries are easy enough to model,
                their objective is to increase others&#39; loss. Each player
                also has a set of possible actions, we can refer to this as a
                strategy space. Modelling objectives is usually the easiest
                part, but modelling the strategy space is where MDs usually get
                tripped up and don&#39;t account for possible errors in their
                design that can be exploited. Not all players are honest, and
                some may exploit any vulnerabilities in your design to further
                their goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can&#39;t just sell a limited run of valuable sneakers and
                expect regular people with a normal wifi connection or 9-5 to be
                able to buy these easily. Rational resellers will develop
                state-of-the-art bots or pay teens to stand in lines if it means
                they can resell them for a greater profit. I&#39;m not a fan of
                the culture of blaming resellers for ruining the sneaker game.
                This is a natural consequence of companies like Nike not
                accounting for secondary markets and their customer base just
                because they have their revenue already. Nike gets away with it
                because they&#39;re Nike, not all MDs can say the same though as
                customers might grow dissatisfied and take their business
                elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                A mechanism designer wants to produce some outcome(s) that
                aligns with their objective and benefits its users as much as
                possible. Some players might gain at the expense of others but
                as long as most people are happy, our job as MD is done. Going
                with the marketplace example again, the outcome produced will be
                the final allocation of goods after the exchange occurs. The MD
                will want to let users exchange goods with each other in a way
                that maximizes the marketplace&#39;s revenue while also
                upholding some level of fairness between every player (not
                privileging bigger firms for example).
            </p>
            <p>
                The mechanism designer must take all this into account and
                design a procedure to <em>systematically</em> produce an ideal
                outcome for themselves and the other agents. This necessarily
                implies designing and expressing the mechanism as an algorithm,
                since we can leverage the many tools and techniques computer
                scientists have developed for formally proving desirable
                properties of algorithms. Notably, a mechanism designer will
                want to produce a provably optimal outcome.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the MD formulates their objective precisely enough (say as
                a mathematical function), they can prove whether the outcome
                output by the algorithm maximizes the objective function (making
                it optimal). Computer scientists call this property
                <em>correctness</em>. We can also analyze algorithms in terms of
                efficiency by finding out how many steps it takes to compute the
                outcome, how much players have to communicate/interact amongst
                themselves and with the MD to use the mechanism, and how much
                data must agents hold while they use the mechanism for the
                rounds required. These measures of efficiency are known as time,
                communication and space complexity respectively, and they are a
                central focus of study in computer science.
            </p>
            <p>
                The inputs in this algorithm are different from the static
                inputs seen in intro comp sci courses. In our case, the inputs
                are the <em>players</em> themselves along with their strategy
                spaces. Given the current state of the mechanism, each player
                will choose their best course of action and the mechanism must
                produce the next outcome according to some predefined procedure.
                Naturally, each player can either choose to be honest (which is
                what we want as MD), or they can <em>deviate</em> and do
                whatever is in their best interest instead. If no player is
                incentivized to do anything but be honest then our mechanism is
                well designed and we can call it a day. Proving that is the hard
                part. :)
            </p>
            <p>
                That being said, how do we also convince our users, the people
                we are trying to attract to our platform, that our mechanism
                does what it set out to do?
            </p>
            <p>
                Normally, an outsider, not privy to the precise algorithm the
                mechanism uses, would have to infer how the mechanism is
                designed and what its objective is by observing the outcomes it
                produces. This is the good ol&#39;
                <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does"
                    ><strong>POSIWID</strong></a
                >
                heuristic. It&#39;s a good heuristic for calling out an
                obviously bad system (it does not work as stated), but it
                can&#39;t convince anyone that a system incentivizes people to
                act honestly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, ordinary users can&#39;t even tell if the
                <em>mechanism designer</em> is playing fair since the source
                code of the algorithm and actions of other users are hidden from
                all but the MD. Recall that the MD has their objectives and
                could act unfairly to further their interests (at their
                users&#39; expense of course). For example, Google has gotten
                slammed with an
                <a
                    href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies"
                    >antitrust suit</a
                >
                for manipulating the Google Ads auction to increase their
                profits.
            </p>
            <p>
                A natural next step in the field of mechanism design would be
                designing a mechanism where even the creator of the mechanism
                cannot influence outcomes in a way that benefits them. This
                property is called <em>credibility</em>. This is hard to do
                since the algorithm is typically closed-source and hosted by the
                mechanism designer so it has a privileged view of all incoming
                actions as well as the ability to <em>censor</em> actions or at
                least delay them.
            </p>
            <p>
                This sets the scene for what blockchains can do for mechanism
                designers and users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blockchains allow for the creation and deployment of
                <em>truly credible</em> mechanisms because of their censorship
                resistance and security/liveness properties along with the
                ability to implement mechanisms as smart contracts that run with
                no central intermediaries. Once your mechanism is deployed
                onchain it can&#39;t be taken down, and works exactly as
                detailed in the source code (which can be open-sourced and
                verified). From there, other properties like fairness,

                can be proven directly and rigorously. Chitra et al. have a
                great paper on how blockchains can enable

                In the antitrust example I gave above, the DOJ was able to step
                in and put a stop to Google&#39;s dishonest actions. It
                isn&#39;t always feasible for the law to step in, especially
                across borders. New mechanisms can be deployed onchain and serve
                credibly and on a global scale on Day 1.

                It&#39;s a simple idea, but also incredibly powerful with huge
                political ramifications. Bitcoin, a completely permissionless
                and decentralized digital currency, was the first application of
                blockchain tech. It showed that this idea was powerful enough to
                power a whole new form of money.

                The part that excites me the most about the blockchain space is
                the fervent energy and belief that we can shape and build our
                own systems and infrastructure of tomorrow, and it can
                <em>provably work for us</em>. I believe so too, and I want a
                hand in shaping that future.
