                I typically have trouble with intuitively reasoning about the
                security of some new cryptographic scheme (?) by following the
                direct proofs in a paper. What I like to start with is taking
                away some parts of a spec and seeing what attacks now succeed as
                a result, that&#39;s how I learn why that part is there in the
                first place. I&#39;m calling this
                <em>Learning by Subtraction</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It&#39;s a simple idea, and by no means novel, but it&#39;s fun
                and it makes me really happy when some piece really
                <em>clicks</em> after seeing what goes wrong when something is
                missing. I&#39;m going to keep adding examples of this idea as I
                come across them.

                When I was at McGill, I took a reading course where I covered
                game theory in blockchain networks. One of the lectures I gave
                on
                <a
                    href="https://www.notion.so/ghili/Bitcoin-3bd628ae48f34190b06fe34160227f08"
                    >bitcoin</a
                >
                helped me really grok why bitcoin is designed the way it is.
                Namely, I understood how double spending was prevented not only
                by Proof of Work but also by linking the blocks together. That
                way, blocks can&#39;t be built retroactively and replaced in a
                newer longest chain. The proof of work in a block must attest to
                the entire chain before it.

                Commitment from Interleaved Codes

                <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1079.pdf"
                    >Foundations of Data Availability Sampling</a
                >
                is a great paper that goes over a number of data availability
                schemes and how they differ by their so-called
                <em>erasure code commitments</em>. One such type of commitment
                the authors construct is the Interleaved Code Commitment which
                looks like this:
            </p>

                <img
                    src="./assets/interleaved_code_commitment.png"

            </p>

                Regular commitment schemes have to ensure certain properties
                like position-binding and completeness to be deemed secure.
                These properties must also hold for erasure code commitments,
                but code-binding is also required. All commitments must be bound
                to a single (known) code \(\mathcal{C}\), so that an adversary
                cannot make any openings to a codeword outside of this code. The
                linear code \(\mathcal{C}\) is a linear subspace, and the
                vectors in it are called codewords. As the vector \(\textbf{w}\)
                in the commitment is assumed to be a random linear combination
                of codewords, \(\textbf{w}\) must also be a codeword. Meaning
                \(\textbf{H}\textbf{w} = 0\) and if not then \(\textbf{w}\) is
                not in the code. The scheme requires we check this to ensure
                <em>all committed elements</em> are in the code. You can easily
                check if an opening \(\textbf{X}_j\) is in the code by checking
                if \(\textbf{H}\textbf{X}_j = 0\), but then you might allow
                non-codewords to sneak past into the commitment if you don&#39;t
                also check \(\textbf{w}\). This is what give this scheme
                code-binding. We also want to check if \(\textbf{w}_j =
                \textbf{r}^T\textbf{X}_j\) because if that were missing then we
                can pass any vector \(\textbf{w}\) in our commitment that might
                be a valid codeword (so it passes all the other checks) but
                won&#39;t contain the opening. We already get position binding
                by checking the hash is in the commitment (in
                \(\text{VerCol.b}\)), so \(\text{VerCol.d}\) is a bit redundant
                but there is no other way to check if the opening is in the
                commitment.
